.# Abstract

DNSSEC deployments have often used the SHA-1 cryptographic hash
algorithm to provide authentication of DNS data. This document
explains why SHA-1 is no longer secure for this purpose, and
deprecates its use in DNSSEC signatures. This document updates
RFC 8624.


{mainmatter}


# Introduction

Since 2005, SHA-1 has been known to be much weaker than it was
designed to be. Over the last 5 years there has been a series of
increasingly powerful demonstrations that SHA-1's weaknesses can be
exploited in practice. In January 2020, GaÃ«tan Leurent and Thomas
Peyrin announced a chosen-prefix collision for SHA-1 [SHA-MBLES]. This
was the first practical break of SHA-1 as used in cryptographic
signatures.

DNSSEC uses cryptographic signatures to authenticate DNS data. Its
signature algorithms include RSASHA1 (5) and RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 (7)
which are vulnerable to chosen-prefix collisions in SHA-1, as
described in section (#collide). This document deprecates these
vulnerable algorithms (#deprecate).

SHA-1 has been deprecated in other situations for several years (see
(#timeline)). This document's timetable for deprecating SHA-1 in
DNSSEC is based on those examples, adapted for the particulars of the
DNS. Section (#seccons) discusses the trade-offs between speed and
security.

As 

The DNS uses SHA-1 for a number of other less vulnerable purposes, as
outlined in section (#otherr).

## Terminology

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**,
**SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**,
and **OPTIONAL** in this document are to be interpreted as described in
[@!RFC2119].


# Deprecating SHA-1 in DNSSEC {#deprecate}

The following table lists the implementation recommendations for
DNSKEY algorithms [@?DNSKEY-IANA]. The change from [@?RFC8624]
section 3.1 is to deprecate algorithms 5 and 7.

No. | Mnemonic           | DNSSEC Signing  | DNSSEC Validation
----|--------------------|-----------------|------------------
1   | RSAMD5             | MUST NOT        | MUST NOT
3   | DSA                | MUST NOT        | MUST NOT
5   | RSASHA1            | MUST NOT        | MUST NOT after 2021
6   | DSA-NSEC3-SHA1     | MUST NOT        | MUST NOT
7   | RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 | MUST NOT        | MUST NOT after 2021
8   | RSASHA256          | MUST            | MUST
10  | RSASHA512          | NOT RECOMMENDED | MUST
12  | ECC-GOST           | MUST NOT        | MAY
13  | ECDSAP256SHA256    | MUST            | MUST
14  | ECDSAP384SHA384    | MAY             | RECOMMENDED
15  | ED25519            | RECOMMENDED     | RECOMMENDED
16  | ED448              | MAY             | RECOMMENDED

The following subsections have recommended timelines for deprecating
algorithms 5 and 7 in specific situations.


## DNSSEC signing software

DNSSEC key management and zone signing software MUST remove support
for algorithms 5 and 7 in their next feature release.


## DNS hosting services

Authoritative DNS hosting services that include DNSSEC signing as part
of the service SHOULD NOT generate a new key with algorithms 5 or 7
for a zone that does not already have a key with the same algorithm.
They MUST NOT do so after the end of 2020.

Zones signed with algorithms 5 or 7 SHOULD be rolled over to a
mandatory or recommended algorithm as soon as possible. The rollovers
MUST be complete before the end of 2021.


## DNSSEC validating software

Validating resolvers SHOULD have a build-time or run-time option to
disable selected DNSKEY algorithms, that is, to treat them as unknown
or insecure.

Algorithms 5 and 7 MUST be disabled in 2022 at the latest. If SHA-1
becomes significantly weaker before then, Algorithms 5 and 7 MUST be
disabled in a security patch release.


## DNS resolver services

Validating resolvers MUST treat algorithms 5 and 7 as unknown or
insecure after the start of 2022, or earlier if SHA-1 becomes
significantly weaker before then.
