<abstract><t>DNSSEC deployments have often used the SHA-1 cryptographic hash
algorithm to provide authentication of DNS data. This document
explains why SHA-1 is no longer secure for this purpose, and
deprecates its use in DNSSEC signatures. This document updates
RFC 8624.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>Since 2005, SHA-1 has been known to be much weaker than it was
designed to be. Over the last 5 years there has been a series of
increasingly powerful demonstrations that SHA-1's weaknesses can be
exploited in practice. In January 2020, GaÃ«tan Leurent and Thomas
Peyrin announced a chosen-prefix collision for SHA-1 [SHA-mbles]. This
was the first practical break of SHA-1 as used in cryptographic
signatures.</t>
<t>DNSSEC uses cryptographic signatures to authenticate DNS data. Its
signature algorithms <xref target="DNSKEY-IANA"></xref> include RSASHA1 (5) and
RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 (7) which are vulnerable to chosen-prefix
collisions in SHA-1, as described in <xref target="collide"></xref>. This document
deprecates these vulnerable algorithms (<xref target="deprecate"></xref>).</t>
<t>SHA-1 has been deprecated in other situations for several years (see
<xref target="timeline"></xref>). This document's timetable for deprecating SHA-1 in
DNSSEC (<xref target="deprecate"></xref>) is based on those examples, adapted for the
particulars of the DNS. <xref target="seccons"></xref> discusses the trade-offs between
speed and security.</t>
<t>A collision attack can be used against DNSSEC in a number of ways,
some of which are explored in <xref target="attack"></xref>. Certain weaknesses in the way
DNSSEC is sometimes deployed can make collision attacks easier to
carry out, or make their consequences more severe. Although the only
sure way to protect against collision attacks is to use a secure
algorithm (<xref target="deprecate"></xref>), <xref target="harden"></xref> and <xref target="attack"></xref> outline some partial
mitigations.</t>
<t>The DNS uses SHA-1 for a number of other less vulnerable purposes, as
outlined in section <xref target="otherr"></xref>.</t>

</texttable><t>The following subsections have recommended timelines for deprecating
algorithms 5 and 7 in specific situations.</t>

<section anchor="dnssec-signing-software" title="DNSSEC signing software">
<t>DNSSEC key management and zone signing software MUST remove support
for algorithms 5 and 7 in their next feature release.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="dns-hosting-services" title="DNS hosting services">
<t>Authoritative DNS hosting services that include DNSSEC signing as part
of the service SHOULD NOT generate a new key with algorithms 5 or 7
for a zone that does not already have a key with the same algorithm.
They MUST NOT do so after the end of 2020.</t>
<t>Zones signed with algorithms 5 or 7 SHOULD be rolled over to a
mandatory or recommended algorithm as soon as possible. The rollovers
MUST be complete before the end of 2021.</t>

<section anchor="dnssec-validating-software" title="DNSSEC validating software">

disable selected DNSKEY algorithms, that is, to treat them as unknown
or insecure.</t>
<t>Algorithms 5 and 7 MUST be disabled in 2022 at the latest. If SHA-1
becomes significantly weaker before then, Algorithms 5 and 7 MUST be
disabled in a security patch release.</t>

<section anchor="ds-and-cds-records" title="DS and CDS records">
<t>A DS or CDS record securely identifies a DNSKEY record using a
cryptographic digest (<xref target="RFC4034"></xref> section 5). One of the digest types
is SHA-1. It is deprecated by <xref target="RFC8624"></xref>.</t>
<t>For this purpose, the digest needs preimage security, which SHA-1
still has, and collision attacks do not affect it.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="nsec3-records" title="NSEC3 records">
<t>NSEC3 is an alternative mechanism for authenticated denial of
existence in DNSSEC. It is based on SHA-1 hashes of domain names. The
NSEC3 specification <xref target="RFC5155"></xref> discusses collisions in some detail.</t>
<t>NSEC3 can be attacked with an identical-prefix collision, which is
simpler than the chosen-prefix collisions that are the main subject
of this document. The best collision known at the time of writing
<xref target="SHAttered"></xref> uses two SHA-1 input blocks (128 bytes) so a collision
could in principle be made to fit into a domain name for an attack
on NSEC3. However it will be difficult to make the colliding domain
names conform to host name syntax, and the attack will be futile
because the signer can defeat it by changing its NSEC3 salt
(<xref target="RFC5155"></xref> section C.2.1).</t>
</section>

<section anchor="sshfp-records" title="SSHFP records">
<t>An SSHFP record securely identifies an SSH server public key using a
cryptographic digest <xref target="RFC4255"></xref>. Although SSHFP SHA-1 digests have
not yet been deprecated, SHA-256 is preferred <xref target="RFC6594"></xref>.</t>
<t>For SSHFP records the digest needs preimage security, which SHA-1
still has, and collision attacks do not affect it.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="tsig-authentication" title="TSIG authentication">
<t>TSIG is a DNS extension for secret-key transaction authentication
<xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-rfc2845bis"></xref>. Its <spanx style="verb">hmac-sha1</spanx> algorithm is
deprecated. Collision attacks do not affect HMAC SHA-1.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="seccons" title="Security considerations">
<t>We find ourselves in an awkward and embarrassing situation. As
<xref target="timeline"></xref> shows, there has been plenty of warning about the
weakness of SHA-1. Other parts of the industry started making
efforts to deprecate it years ago. But DNSSEC has been complacent.</t>
<t>At the time of writing, there are 1516 top-level domains, of which
1102 use secure DNSSEC algorithms, 274 use algorithms 5 or 7 (RSA
SHA-1), and 140 are insecure. In the reverse DNS, 3 RIRs use secure
DNSSEC algorithms, 2 RIRs use algorithm 5, and many of the non-RIR
legacy delegations are insecure.</t>

<section anchor="staying-secure" title="Staying secure">
<t>There are still many domains that depend on SHA-1 to secure
applications that use DNSSEC, such as issuing TLS certificates
<xref target="RFC6844"></xref> <xref target="RFC8555"></xref>, sending inter-domain email <xref target="RFC7672"></xref>,
and authenticating SSH servers <xref target="RFC4255"></xref>.</t>
<t>Some applications use the &quot;authenticated data&quot; (AD bit) signal from
DNSSEC to make security decisions, and will fail if it unexpectedly
switches off. Other applications use DNSSEC passively and will
silently go insecure. In either case we would prefer them to
continue working as if secure, as long as SHA-1 is still
significantly better than insecure DNS.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="when-to-declare-sha-1-insecure" title="When to declare SHA-1 insecure">
<t>At the time of writing, a SHA-1 chosen-prefix collision costs less
than US$100,000 in computer time, takes about a month, and requires
the attention of expert cryptanalysts. Attacks seem to be getting
better by a factor of 3 or 4 per year.</t>
<t>There is not much time before collisions become affordable, and
possible for non-experts to calculate. <xref target="deprecate"></xref> hopes this will
not happen within the next 2 years.</t>
<t>This 2 year guess is likely to be too optimistic, so DNSSEC
validators need to be prepared to disable support for SHA-1 by
configuration change or security patch as soon as a significantly
improved attack on SHA-1 is announced.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="avoiding-unwanted-insecurity" title="Avoiding unwanted insecurity">
<t>The reason for not deprecating SHA-1 immediately is to allow time to
perform algorithm rollovers, so that zones will continue to be secure.</t>
<t>Abruptly forcing SHA-1 zones to be treated as insecure may encourage
their operators to leave them insecure, instead of encouraging them
to upgrade to a secure algorithm.</t>
